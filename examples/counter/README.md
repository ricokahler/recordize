# Counter Example for Recordize

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

See [`App.js`](./src/App.js) for the important source code. The rest of the files were created with create-react-app.

# Running the example:

```bash
# from the `recordize` root
cd examples/counter
npm start
```
